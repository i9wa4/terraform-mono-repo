# This file is now obsolete. Its contents have been refactored into:
# - lambdas/my_example_lambda/versions.tf
# - terraform_cicd/versions.tf
#
# The backend configuration is now specific to each component (lambda instance, cicd).
# The provider configuration is also handled within each component's .tf files.
#
# This file can be removed.
